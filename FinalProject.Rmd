# Introduction

**Research question:**

-   Our research question is: "Does footwear type affect running speed?"

-   More specifically, we want to see whether running times around a track differ when different people run in **sneakers, flip-flops, running shoes, or barefoot.**

**Context/motivation**

-   Footwear is a big part of everyday life and sports performance. Runners often invest in specialized shoes, but people also sometimes run in casual shoes or even barefoot. We were interested in whether these different footwear choices actually lead to **measurable differences in running speed** over a fixed distance of a half mile. Our experiment uses a simple track setting a repeated timed runs to compare running performance across four footwear conditions.

# Experimental Design

**Factors and treatment structure**

-   Factor (treatment): Footwear type

-   Levels (4):

    -   Sneakers

    -   Flip-flops

    -   Running shoes

    -   Barefoot

Each observation in our data-set is two timed laps (one half mile) around the track under one of these four footwear conditions

**Response variable and units**

-   Response variable: Time to complete two laps around the track

-   Units: Seconds (continuous)

We recorded the lap times in seconds for each run.

**Fixed vs. random factors**

-   Footwear type: Fixed factor

    -   We are specifically interested in these four footwear conditions, so the levels are not randomly sampled from a larger population of footwear types.

-   Runner (subject): Can be treated as a random effect/source of variability

    -   We had five group members, but only 4 could run; these runners represent a small sample from a broader population of runners, and we mainly want to control for differences in baseline speed between people rather than compare these individuals specifically.

-   Day: Used as a fixed blocking factor to control for time-related effects such as fatigue across days and other day-to-day variation.

**Design type**

-   The design can be described as: 4x4 Latin Square

    -   A comparative experiment with one main treatment factor (footwear type), with blocking by day to reduce variability due to changing conditions (fatigue, weather, etc.)

-   We used a 4x4 Latin Square design with day and runners as the blocking factors and footwear type as the primary treatment factor

**Randomization, replication, and blocking**

-   **Blocking:**

    -   We ran the experiment over 4 separate days each day with 4 independent runners

    -   We treated "day" as a block to control for:

        -   Changes in weather,

        -   Possible fatigue from previous days,

        -   Other day-to-day conditions that could affect running times.

    -   Runners are the second block in our Latin Square. This is to control for:

        - Differences in athleticism, 
        
        - Specific brands of the same shoe type

        - Physical state (energy levels, soreness, etc).

-   **Randomization:**

    -   On each day, we randomized which footwear each runner would use for that day.

    -   The order of footwear across days was randomized so that no particular footwear was always run on the "best" or "worst" day.

-   **Replication:**

    -   Each active runner completed two laps in the same footwear condition on a given day

    -   We also have replication across runners, since multiple people ran in the same footwear type.

**Sample size**: Provide number of observations per condition. Guideline: 5–10 per treatment for CRD, 3–5 blocks for RCBD, total feasible within 1 hour.

-   Number of runners: 4 (one group member had a foot injury and served as timekeeper)

-   Runs per runner per condition: 1 run (2 laps) in the same footwear on that day.

-   Number of days (blocks): 4

-   Footwear conditions: 4 types total

# Data Collection
**Procedure**: Describe how and when the experiment was conducted (e.g., location, date, steps taken).

-   We conducted the experiment on the outdoor track on campus over four separate days (Sunday November 23 - Wednesday November 26)

-   On each day, the same 4 group members who were able to run came to the track.

-   The fifth member had a foot injury and served as the designated time keeper, using a stopwatch to record lap times.

-   At the start of each day, we randomly assigned each the footwear conditions for all runners on that day, according to the predetermined 4x4 Latin Square.

-   Each runner then completed two laps around the track in that assigned footwear.

-   At the end of the two laps, the time keeper recorded the lap time in seconds, keeping track on a piece of paper.

**Challenges/Adjustments**: Mention any difficulties or changes made during data collection (e.g., technical issues, time adjustments).

-   Human timekeeping can lead to human error where the lap times are not 100% accurate.

-   Not everyone had the exact same shoe - we kept it general but not brand-specific, could lead to deviation.

-   Because we were concerned about fatigue and changing weather, we spread the data collection across four days and treated day as a block
    - Some scheduling issues led to time delay - a realworld effect on experiment efficiency

-   Minor fluctuations in weather or track conditions across days are possible, which is one reason we used blocking and randomization.

# Analysis

- **Exploratory Data**: Start with basic statistics (mean, SD) and visualizations (e.g., boxplots) to understand the data.


- **Hypothesis Testing**: Test your hypothesis with an appropriate statistical test (e.g., ANOVA).

- **Tables, Figures, & Code**: Include key results (ANOVA table, post-test) and relevant `R` code excerpts where needed.

-	Use `R` to analyze the data.

# Conclusions
-	Summarize key findings.
- Comment on limitations and possible improvements.
