# Introduction
-	Clear statement of the objective or research question.
-	Brief context or motivation.

# Experimental Design
- Description of factors and treatment structure.
- Clearly state what you are measuring and the units.
Examples: Number of words recalled (count), reaction time (seconds), taste rating (1–5 scale).
- Identify which factors are fixed vs. random.
- Description of design type (CRD, RCBD, factorial, etc.).
- Explain how randomization, replication, and (if used) blocking were implemented.
- Sample size: Provide number of observations per condition.
Guideline: 5–10 per treatment for CRD, 3–5 blocks for RCBD, total feasible within 1 hour.

(You are encouraged to explore more resources for determining the sample size )



# Data Collection
- **Procedure**: Describe how and when the experiment was conducted (e.g., location, date, steps taken).
- **Challenges/Adjustments**: Mention any difficulties or changes made during data collection (e.g., technical issues, time adjustments).
- **Data Presentation**: Display the collected data in tables or graphs, summarizing key measures like mean and standard deviation..

# Analysis

- **Exploratory Data**: Start with basic statistics (mean, SD) and visualizations (e.g., boxplots) to understand the data.


- **Hypothesis Testing**: Test your hypothesis with an appropriate statistical test (e.g., ANOVA).

- **Tables, Figures, & Code**: Include key results (ANOVA table, post-test) and relevant `R` code excerpts where needed.

-	Use `R` to analyze the data.

# Conclusions
-	Summarize key findings.
- Comment on limitations and possible improvements.


# References
 (If needed.)

# Appendices
 
 - `R` code.
